# SmallSteps
A mobile application built using Django and ReactJS based on the works of Charles Duhigg (Author of The Power of Habit) and James Clear (Author of Atomic Habits) in helping people build habits from the ground up. This is a project hatched from participating in the Rewriting The Code (RTC) program, Code2Gether.
